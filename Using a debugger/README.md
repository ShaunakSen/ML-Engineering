1. Breakpoints cause a program to pause execution __before__ the line on which the breakpoint is applied

2. Breakpoint control buttons
    - Continue: continue execution until you hit the next breakpoint
    - Locals panel keeps track of all vars
    - call stack is like the function call stack
    - Beside Terminal tab there is an option  "Debug Console" which you can use to explore the current vars in more details
